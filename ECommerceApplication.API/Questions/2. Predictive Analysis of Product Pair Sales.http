# Story: Predictive Analysis of Product Pair Sales
#
# As a data analyst, improve our marketing by identifying frequently bought product pairs to
# enhance product placement and cross-selling opportunities.
#
# Acceptance Criteria:
# 1. Data Access:
#    - Retrieve order data (ECommerceApplication.Data.Db.Orders), noting each order may contain multiple products.
#
# 2. Algorithm Focus:
#    - Calculate the frequency of each product pair in the same transaction.
#    - Ensure high efficiency in time and space complexity due to large data volumes.
#
# 3. Return Data:
#    - Return a list of the top N product pairs by co-occurrence frequency.
#
# 4. Parameterization:
#    - Accept an integer N to specify how many top pairs to return.
#
# Example API Request:
GET http://localhost:5141/products/top-pairs?topN=5

# Expected JSON Output:
# [
#   { "products": [ "Running Shoes", "Socks" ], "frequency": 3 },
#   { "products": [ "Laptop", "Smartphone" ], "frequency": 2 },
#   { "products": [ "Gaming Chair", "Gaming Monitor" ], "frequency": 2 },
#   { "products": [ "Blouse", "Jeans" ], "frequency": 1 },
#   { "products": [ "Blouse", "Smartphone" ], "frequency": 1 }
# ]
# Note: The solution must efficiently handle potentially large data sets and deliver
# structured data to inform marketing and inventory strategies.
